#Dev with SimpleCV

SimpleCV is a package operated with Python based on Computer Vision, Image Processing and Machine Learning. It is built on OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy and several other dependencies intended to make it more easy to use, efficient, and, *Pythonic*!

#Build and Run Instructions

You will find instructions for each of the scripts/modules written at the beginning. For kicking off,

At the Python console,
>>```import start```
>>```start.into()```

This will bring you into the Shell() of the SimpleCV package, with which an interactive Python shell is enclosed. Remember that these files should be saved at your /Python27/ folder.

For running the consequent files, do the same.
>>```import file_name```

Also, keep in mind that this is to be done *after getting into the shell*.
