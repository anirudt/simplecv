#Dev with SimpleCV

SimpleCV is a package operated with Python based on Computer Vision, Image Processing and Machine Learning. It is built on OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy and several other dependencies intended to make it more easy to use, efficient, and, *Pythonic*!

Build instructions and further details soon to come.
